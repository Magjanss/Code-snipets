# ## Introduction
#
# In this assignment you will implement a probabilistic classifier for
# handwritten digit recognition: a system that takes an image of a
# digit as its input, and predicts the digit depicted in it.
#
# To train and evaluate your system, you will use the 70,000 images in
# the MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits:
#
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database
#
# Each image in this database consists of 28x28 pixels with grayscale
# values, and has been manually labelled with the digit depicted in
# the image. For the purposes of this assignment, the grayscale values
# have been converted to black-or-white values.

# ## Problem 0
#
# Write code that reads the training data for the assignment, picks
# out 10 random images, one for each digit, and writes the images to
# disk as PNG files.
#
# Use the following code pattern to loop over the training data:
#
# for image, digit in mnist.read_training_data():
#     ...
#
# On the Python side of things, an image is represented as a tuple
# with 784 components: each component corresponds to a pixel, and has
# a value of either 1 or 0 ("black" or "white").
#
# To save images as PNG files, use `png.save_png()`. This function
# takes four arguments: (1) the width of the image to be generated,
# (2) its height, (3) a list with the grayscale values of the image
# (integers between 0 and 255), and (4) the name of the file to which
# the image should be written. Call the function like this:
#
# png.save_png(28, 28, values, 'digit-{}.png'.format(digit))


def make_images():

    digitToGet = 0
    imageNumber = 0
    for image, digit in mnist.read_training_data():
        imageNumber += 1
        if digit == digitToGet :
            # HERE we add a random coin toss to get diffrent sets!
            if cointoss():
                values = [255 - 255*i for i in image]
                png.save_png(28, 28, values, 'digit-{}.png'.format(digit))
                if DEBUG:
                    print("Image number: {}".format(digitToGet))

        if digitToGet == 10:
            break
    print("Scanned through {} images".format(imageNumber))

# ## Problem 1
#
# The first problem that you have to solve is to estimate the two
# types of probabilities required by the classifier:
#
# 1. For each possible digit d, the a priori probability that an image
# represents d, rather than any other digit. You should estimate this
# probability as the percentage of images in the training data that
# have been labelled with d.
#
# To store probabilities of type 1, use a dictionary `pd` that maps
# digits (integers) to probabilities (floats). For example, `pd[7]`
# should give the probability that a random image depicts the digit 7.
#
# 2. For each possible digit d and each possible pixel p (indexed by
# an integer between 0 and 783), the conditional probability that p is
# black given that the image represents d. You should estimate this
# probability as the percentage of d-images in the training data in
# which pixel p is black.
#
# To store probabilities of type 2, use a two-layer dictionary
# `pp`. For example, `pp[7][42]` should give the conditional
# probability that pixel 42 is black in a random image of the digit 7.
#
# Implementation detail: To avoid zero probabilities, pretend that
# each pixel is black in one additional d-image. For example, if pixel
# 0 is never black in images of the digit 7, pretend that it is
# actually black in 1 image; and if pixel 391 is black in 130 images
# of the digit 7, pretend that it is actually black in 131 images.
#
# The following numbers may be useful for debugging:
#
# * Number of images depicting the digit 7: 6265
# * Number of black pixels in images depiciting the digit 7: 568207
# * The same number, but including "hallucinated" pixels: 568991

# ## Problem 2
#
# Once you have estimated the relevant probabilities, you can use them
# to predict the digit that a given image represents. Implement the
# following algorithm: For each possible digit d, compute a "score",
# defined as the product of the a priori probability that the image
# represents d (from the `pd` dictionary) and, for each black pixel p
# in the image, the conditional probability that p is black given that
# the image represents d (from the `pp` dictionary). Then, return that
# digit which got the highest score.
#
# Implementation detail: Probabilities are small numbers, and when
# many small numbers are multiplied, there is a risk for underflow. To
# avoid this, convert all numbers to logarithmic scale (using
# `math.log`) and add probabilities instead of multiplying them.
